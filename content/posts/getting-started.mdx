# Getting Started with MDX

MDX combines the power of Markdown with React. This guide will help you create your first post.

## Creating a New Post

To create a new blog post, add a `.mdx` file to the `content/posts` directory with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2024-12-25"
description: "A brief description"
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

## Markdown Syntax

All standard Markdown syntax is supported:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Lists and numbered lists
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting

## Using Components

Since this is MDX, you can use React components directly:

<div style={{ padding: '10px', backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0', borderRadius: '4px' }}>
  This is a styled div using inline React!
</div>

## Tips

- Keep posts organized with descriptive filenames
- Use frontmatter to add metadata
- Use tags to categorize your posts
- Write engaging content!
